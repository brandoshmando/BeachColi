BeachColi
=========
BeachColi is an app that taps into the City of Toronto's live database displaying ecoli levels at each of the city's eleven beaches. The app takes this data, displays it on a map with custom markers letting the user know where it is and is not safe to swim on that particular day. The app also has pages for each beach individually that displays historical data, weather, and ammentities provided by that particular beach. Take a look at the live project [here](http://beachcoli.herokuapp.com/).
Contributions
---------------
BeachColi is a project that I worked on with [Alessia Bellisario](https://github.com/alessbell), [Vladimir Dralo](https://github.com/vlad-ninja), and [Hassan Jalil](https://github.com/hassanjalilk) at AngelHackTO. I am particularly proud of this group because at this point we had all only been at Bitmaker Labs for three weeks and we had just learned rails the week before. By the end of the hackathon, we were one of few teams to have a fully completed and functioning product. Take a look at the [original repository](https://github.com/vlad-ninja/Beachr)

My contributions included:
* Database relationships
* Scraping and parsing the data using the [Nokogiri Gem](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri)
* Utilizing weather data from the [Forecast.io Gem](https://github.com/darkskyapp/forecast-ruby)
* Pairing on google maps/javascript implementation (none of us new javascript at this point...)
* Deploying to heroku
